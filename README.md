  This phone app uses React Native.js and Expo CLI to create a personal assistant.

## Setting-Up and Viewing in Expo
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install node modules by running `npm install` in the command line.
3. Create an API key at the [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) website.
4. Create a .env file in the root of the app.
5. Add this API key into the .env file under `APP_ID='insert_API_key_here'`.
6. Run `npm start` in the command line to start the the development server.
7. Install the [Expo client app](https://expo.io/) on your phone.
8. Connect to the same wireless network as the computer running the development server.
9. Open your project:

**Android:** use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal.

**iOS:** use your camera app to scan the QR code from your terminal. You will be prompted to enter the Expo app if the scan was successful.
